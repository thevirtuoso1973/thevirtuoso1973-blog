I will be using this site as a place to host my portfolio, résumé, personal
projects, and maybe even a [blog](/posts). 

Here's my [CV/résumé](/pdfs/Chris_CV_2020_For_Online.pdf) (or just the [summary](/cv)) and
here are [my projects](/showcase).

Check out my [socials](/social) to see where else I reside.

## Recruiter?

Are you a recruiter? Have a look at [my project showcase](/showcase), if interested.

I recommend playing my JavaScript [maze game](/showcase/random-maze-game/) to give yourself a 
break from reading CVs.
