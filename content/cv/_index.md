### Personal Interests:

I enjoy ‘hobby-coding’ where I complete challenges on coding/programming
websites to get high scores and try to develop more efficient algorithms than
the other users on the site. In addition, I like undertaking small coding
projects and browsing/inspecting other people’s open-source projects on Github.
I have a deep musical interest and spend time every week practicing the guitar,
as well as occasionally engaging in song writing. I previously studied and
received a ‘Merit’ in Grade 2 Guitar, however in recent years I have purely self-taught myself.
