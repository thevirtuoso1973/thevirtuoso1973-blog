# Background

I initially started my blog/portfolio on Github pages using a mix of Jekyll and just plain
old hand-written HTML, but I decided it was time for me to switch to something a
little nicer looking. 

(I mostly just wanted a dark-theme without having to delve into the CSS myself.)

# Initial Setup
I started with Hugo's quick-start guide.
The quick-start guide was indeed a quick, but shallow, entry-point into the Hugo
framework. I recommend it if you are simply interested in setting up a
simplistic blog, with the front page just consisting of a list of every post made.

If this sounds like you, feel free to just head [over
there](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) and start building.

I will be explaining in this post how to get a static site working with a slightly
different layout, which requires a (somewhat) deeper understanding.

# Getting a Front-Page
